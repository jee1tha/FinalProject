# FinalProject
Business Operations layer and Database Link Layer of Project InGrow

Project InGrow will be an easy to use, user friendly application which would allow organizations to train artificial neural network models so that it would assist them in identifying the most suitable candidates for the available vacancy. 
This application will be a web based application since the connectivity to the user interface must be extended to the World Wide Web so that organizations would be able to gather information from various geographies, which increases the probability of finding a good candidate.
